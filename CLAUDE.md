---

## Design System & Aesthetic

### Core Design Philosophy

**Aesthetic Preferences**
- Favor clean, purposeful interfaces over decorative elements
- Appreciate retro computing aesthetics that prioritize function
- Value consistency between development tools and personal branding
- Prefer authentic materials and interactions over superficial polish

**Technical Philosophy**
- Quality implementation over rapid feature delivery
- Sustainable, maintainable solutions over quick fixes
- Creative problem-solving within practical constraints
- Tools that enhance focus rather than create distraction

### Visual Design Language

**Terminal-Inspired Aesthetic**
The entire site uses a cohesive terminal/command-line aesthetic that reinforces Dan's identity as a thoughtful developer:

- **Section Headers**: Terminal commands that relate to content
  - About: `dan@localhost:~ $ whoami`
  - Projects: `dan@localhost:~ $ ls -la projects/`
  - Blog: `dan@localhost:~ $ cat blog/*.md`
  - Contact: `dan@localhost:~ $ ./connect.sh`

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Aesthetic portions (prompt, path, $) at 50% opacity, meaningful content fully opaque and bold

**Color Palette** (Tailwind 4 OKLCH Implementation)
```css
@theme {
  /* Navy color scale - Dark theme backgrounds */
  --color-navy-950: oklch(0.15 0.04 240);  /* #0a192f - Primary background */
  --color-navy-900: oklch(0.18 0.04 240);  /* #112240 - Card backgrounds */
  --color-navy-800: oklch(0.25 0.04 240);  /* #233554 - Borders, elevated surfaces */
  
  /* Slate color scale - Text hierarchy */
  --color-slate-50: oklch(0.92 0.02 240);  /* #e6f1ff - Highest contrast text */
  --color-slate-100: oklch(0.85 0.02 240); /* #ccd6f6 - Primary headings */
  --color-slate-200: oklch(0.72 0.02 240); /* #a8b2d1 - Secondary content */
  --color-slate-300: oklch(0.6 0.02 240);  /* #8892b0 - Body text */
  
  /* Accent colors - Brand highlights */
  --color-teal-400: oklch(0.8 0.14 180);   /* #64ffda - Primary accent */
  --color-fuchsia-400: oklch(0.7 0.24 320); /* #f57dff - Secondary accent */
  --color-sky-400: oklch(0.72 0.16 220);   /* #57cbff - Tertiary accent */
  
  /* Semantic colors - Status indicators */
  --color-emerald-500: oklch(0.64 0.17 150); /* #22c55e - Success */
  --color-amber-500: oklch(0.7 0.15 70);     /* #f59e0b - Warning */
  --color-red-500: oklch(0.59 0.22 25);      /* #ef4444 - Error */
  --color-blue-500: oklch(0.58 0.16 260);    /* #3b82f6 - Info */

  /* Typography */
  --font-family-sans: 'Calibre', 'Inter', 'San Francisco', 'SF Pro Text', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-family-mono: 'SF Mono', 'Fira Code', 'Fira Mono', 'Roboto Mono', monospace;
}
```

**Using Colors in Components**
```html
<!-- Background colors -->
<div class="bg-navy-950">Primary background</div>
<div class="bg-navy-900">Card background</div>
<div class="bg-navy-800">Elevated surface</div>

<!-- Text colors -->
<h1 class="text-slate-100">Primary heading</h1>
<p class="text-slate-200">Secondary content</p>
<span class="text-slate-300">Body text</span>

<!-- Accent colors -->
<a class="text-teal-400 hover:text-slate-50">Primary link</a>
<button class="bg-teal-400 text-navy-950">Primary button</button>
<span class="text-fuchsia-400">Secondary accent</span>

<!-- Semantic colors -->
<div class="text-emerald-500">Success message</div>
<div class="text-amber-500">Warning message</div>
<div class="text-red-500">Error message</div>
```

**Future Theme Support**
The OKLCH color system provides excellent foundation for future themes:
- Light theme: Invert lightness values while maintaining chroma/hue
- High contrast: Increase chroma values for better accessibility
- Custom themes: Easy to adjust hue while keeping consistent lightness scales

**Typography**
- **Primary**: 'Calibre', 'Inter', 'San Francisco', 'SF Pro Text', system-ui, sans-serif
- **Monospace**: 'SF Mono', 'Fira Code', 'Fira Mono', 'Roboto Mono', monospace
- **Scale**: Uses relative units (rem) for accessibility and scalability

## Animation & Interaction Guidelines

### Core Animations

**Terminal Cursor Blink**
```css
@keyframes blink {
  0%, 50% { opacity: 1; }
  51%, 100% { opacity: 0; }
}

.terminal-cursor {
  animation: blink 1s infinite;
  background-color: var(--color-accent-primary);
}
```

**Typewriter Effect** (Optional for hero section)
```css
@keyframes typewriter {
  from { width: 0; }
  to { width: 100%; }
}

.typewriter {
  overflow: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
  animation: typewriter 2s steps(40, end);
}
```

### Interaction States

**Hover Effects**
- Links: Transition color to `--color-text-inverse` with underline
- Cards: Subtle elevation with `transform: translateY(-2px)`
- Buttons: Background color transition with `--color-accent-hover`

**Focus States**
- Always visible focus ring using `--color-accent-focus`
- Never remove focus indicators, only style them
- Keyboard navigation must be smooth and logical

**Page Transitions**
- Prefer fade transitions (150-200ms) for route changes
- No jarring animations or excessive motion
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

### Loading States
- Terminal-style progress indicators using ASCII characters
- Example: `[████████░░] 80% Loading...`
- Skeleton screens should use terminal-aesthetic placeholders

---

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Error Pages

**404 Page Design**
```astro
<Terminal>
  <TerminalHeader command="cd /nonexistent-page" />
  <pre class="error-output">
bash: cd: /nonexistent-page: No such file or directory

$ ls suggestions/
../  about/  blog/  contact/  projects/
  </pre>
</Terminal>
```

**500 Error Page**
```astro
<Terminal variant="full">
  <pre class="error-output">
[ERROR] Internal Server Error
Stack trace:
  at Object.serverError (/src/pages/[...slug].astro:42:15)
  
$ ./report-issue.sh
  </pre>
</Terminal>
```

### Empty States

**No Projects**
```
$ ls -la projects/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  2 dan  staff  64 Mar 15 10:00 .
drwxr-xr-x  5 dan  staff 160 Mar 15 10:00 ..

$ echo "Projects coming soon..."
```

**No Blog Posts**
```
$ find . -name "*.md" -type f
$ echo "First post in progress..."
```

### Form Validation
- Error messages in terminal output style
- Example: `[ERROR] Email format invalid: missing @ symbol`
- Success messages: `[SUCCESS] Message sent successfully`
- Field-level validation with real-time feedback

### Network Errors
- Graceful degradation for offline functionality
- Cache strategic resources for offline viewing
- Display connection status in terminal style:
  ```
  $ ping api.danlouren.co
  ping: cannot resolve api.danlouren.co: No connection
  ```

## Content Guidelines

### Image Requirements

**Formats & Optimization**
- Primary format: WebP with JPEG/PNG fallbacks
- Use Astro's Image component for automatic optimization
- Lazy loading for below-fold images

**Standard Sizes**
- Hero images: 1920x1080 (16:9)
- Project cards: 600x400 (3:2)
- Blog post headers: 1200x630 (OG image size)
- Inline blog images: 800px max width
- Thumbnails: 300x200

**Alt Text Requirements**
- Descriptive, not redundant with surrounding text
- Include relevant details for context
- Avoid "image of" or "picture of" prefixes
- Empty alt="" for decorative images only

**Terminal-Themed Screenshots**
- Consistent terminal window styling
- Use SF Mono or Fira Code font
- Apply syntax highlighting for code
- Include window chrome (traffic lights) for context

### Code Examples

**Syntax Highlighting Theme**
```css
/* Based on terminal color scheme */
.hljs {
  background: var(--color-bg-secondary);
  color: var(--color-text-secondary);
}
.hljs-keyword { color: var(--color-accent-secondary); }
.hljs-string { color: var(--color-accent-primary); }
.hljs-comment { color: var(--color-text-tertiary); }
.hljs-function { color: var(--color-accent-tertiary); }
```

**Language Support**
- JavaScript/TypeScript (primary)
- HTML/CSS
- Python
- Bash/Shell
- JSON/YAML
- Markdown

**Code Block Format**
````markdown
```typescript
// Always include language identifier
function sustainableCode(): void {
  // Use comments to explain complex logic
  const result = computeEfficiently();
  return result;
}
```
````

**Terminal Command Formatting**
```markdown
$ npm install        # Comments after commands
$ npm run dev        # Start development server
```

### Writing Guidelines

**Blog Post Structure**
1. Hook - Engaging opening that states the problem
2. Context - Why this matters now
3. Solution - Practical approach with examples
4. Implementation - Code samples and walkthrough
5. Impact - Real-world implications
6. Call to Action - Next steps for readers

**SEO Optimization**
- Focus keyword in title, URL, and first paragraph
- Meta descriptions 150-160 characters
- Use semantic HTML (h2, h3 hierarchy)
- Internal linking to related content
- Schema markup for articles

**Accessibility in Content**
- Heading hierarchy must be logical
- Links have descriptive text (not "click here")
- Complex concepts have simple explanations
- Technical jargon is defined on first use
- Lists used for sequential information
