		<p class="text-primary text-md mb-4">
			With well over a decade of experience across fintech, government, and enterprise platforms, I bridge the gap between complex technical requirements and elegant, human-centered solutions. I've architected applications for federal agencies, worked on high-traffic e-commerce platforms, and delivered mission-critical tooling at high-profile financial institutions &mdash; consistently recognized by colleagues for my technical leadership and ability to guide teams through challenging transistions.
		</p>
		<p class="text-primary text-md">
			I believe great software isn't just about clean code &mdash; it's about building experiences that truly serve users and creating systems that teams can actually maintain. Whether mentoring developers, solving complex architectural challenges, or leading cross-functional collaboration, I bring both technical expertise and communication skills to make complex concepts accessible.
