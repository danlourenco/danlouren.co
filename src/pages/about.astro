        <h2>Hey, I'm Dan.</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a front-end architect who builds thoughtful, accessible digital
          experiences that put users first.
        </p>

        <p>
          My professional journey spans over a decade working with organizations
          &mdash; from scrappy startups to Fortune 500 enterprises &mdash; with
          a focus on creating web applications that improve people's lives. I've
          led complete platform modernizations for national restaurant chains,
          built accessible government systems serving millions of citizens, and
          architected financial tools that help advisors better serve their
          clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          I approach every project with curiosity about the real problems we're
          solving and the people who will ultimately use what we build. This
          perspective, combined with my technical expertise in modern web,
          accessibility standards, and JavaScript frameworks, allows me to
          deliver solutions that are robust and impactful.
        </p>

        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>

        <p>
          I'm passionate about using technology to create positive social impact
          and improve people's lives. I'm drawn to work that aligns with my
          values &mdash; particularly in sustainability, electrification, and
          climate tech. I thrive in complex problem spaces where good UX meets
          systems thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe technology should empower people, not manipulate them for
          engagement or profit. This philosophy guides everything from my
          approach to accessibility testing, to my choice of projects and the
          teams I want to work with.
        </p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Thoughtful Innovation:</strong> I don't chase <em>every</em> framework
          or trend. Instead, I focus on understanding the unique needs of each project
          and selecting the right tools and technologies to meet those needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Knowledge Sharing:</strong> My colleagues often recognize my mentoring
          and teaching abilities, and I enjoy helping others grow their skills and
          knowledge. I believe the best technical work happens when teams level up
          together
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Systems Thinking:</strong> Having worked across regulated industries
          like finance and government, I understand how to build within constrains
          while still delivering best-in-class user experiences.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Focus</h2>

        <p>
          I'm seeking my next chapter with mission-driven teams &mdash;
          particularly in climate tech and sustainability &mdash; where
          thoughtful innovation meets meaningful impact. I want to contribute to
          solutions that don't just work well technically, but actually make the
          world a little better.
        </p>
